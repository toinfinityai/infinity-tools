# VisionFit API

The VisionFit API generates synthetic data for applications at the intersection of computer **vision** and **fit**ness. The API allows users to generate videos of realistic avatars performing a variety of exercises. Our pixel-perfect labels include everything from semantic segmentation masks and rep counts to 2D and 3D keypoints (with camera matrices!).

# VisionFit Client Library

This `visionfit` client library adds higher-level functionality and abstractions on top of the base RESTful Infinity API. This includes ergonomics for interacting with the cloud API and data science/ML tools. The `visionfit` library contains the following submodules:

- [api.py](./api.py): This module contains abstractions and ergonomic functionality built on top of [common.api.py](../common/api.py) specific for the VisionFit API. Some key components include functions to randomly sample input parameters (while specifying any subset exactly), validation of input parameters against constraints, functions to support a preview/full video dichotomy, and functions to support parametric sweeping and re-running from previous state.
- [datagen.py](./datagen.py): This module defines a `VisionFitGenerator` class that can be used as a data generator when training sequence-based models (e.g. RNNs) on the VisionFit API's outputs. It defines data pre-processing functions specific to the VisionFit API, including data loading and featurization.
- [rnn.py](./rnn.py): This module defines a `VisionFitModel` wrapper class, useful for training Keras models on data generated by the VisionFit API.
- [vis.py](./vis.py): This module defines visualization and summarization functions specific to the VisionFit API.

# VisionFit Tutorial Notebooks

We refer users to the [Infinity API Tutorials](https://github.com/toinfinityai/infinity-tutorials/tree/main/visionfit) repo for extensive notebook examples that make use of this `visionfit` client library.
