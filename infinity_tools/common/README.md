# Infinity API Common Tools

The `common` submodule contains functionality applicable across generators (*e.g.*, both [SenseFit](../sensefit/) and [VisionFit](../visionfit/)). This includes ergonomics for interacting with asynchronous cloud APIs and data science/ML tools. The `common` module contains the following submodules:

- [api.py](./api.py): This module contains abstractions and ergonomic functionality for interacting with the Infinity REST API. Some key components include data structures such as `Batch` useful for managing job/batch asynchronous workflows and functions for submitting, serializing/deserializing, polling, and awaiting submitted jobs/batches.
- [ml.py](./ml/): This module contains utility functions for training ML models on top of the synthetic data generated by the Infinity API. This includes data ingestion, featurization, model creation, training, and inference.
- [vis.py](./vis/): This module contains common utility functions for visualizing the synthetic data generated by the Infinity API.

# Infinity API Tutorial Notebooks

The [Infinity API Tutorials](https://github.com/toinfinityai/infinity-tutorials) repo provides extensive notebook examples that make use of the `infinity_tools` libary. It also provides detailed documentation on API inputs and outputs, including the labels provided with synthetic data.
